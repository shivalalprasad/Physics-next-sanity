              Indian physicist Sir CV Raman&apos;s discovery of the Raman effect in 1928. The day is commemorated by
              organizing science exhibitions, seminars, workshops, and other activities. The National Council of Science
              and Technology Communication (NCSTC) has designated National Science Day in India to encourage scientific
              temper and temperament among the Indian people. This day also highlights the importance of science and
              technology in daily life, as well as the need for taking steps to promote scientific research and

              past, the department is charged up to organize a State
              Level Workshop on a topic of Redesigning UG
              Physics Syllabus under Revised CBCS Curriculum.
              To bring the uniformity in undergraduate course
              structure among all the state universities, Telangana
              State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) has
              revised the UG curriculum with effective from 2019-
              20. As per revised UG course structure optional
              subjects papers are reduced from eight(8) to six(6).
              Keeping in view of UG course template and time
              limitation, some part of syllabus is removed in the
              proposed course structure particularly in Physics. As
              this revision is exercised only in Telangana State our
              students appearing for PG entrances of Central
              Universities and other competitive exams at national
              level will lose chances.</p>

              them to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter. To ensure a successful seminar, the
              instructor must prepare an engaging topic, provide clear instructions, and encourage participation. The
              students should also be well-prepared by reading assigned materials beforehand. Overall, student seminars

              administered in a variety of ways, from paper-based tests to online assessments, making them a flexible
              and widely used tool in educational institutions. Students should approach quizzes with a positive
